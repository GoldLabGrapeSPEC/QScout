Algorithm Parameters:

Basic parameters
OUTPUT: the layer that the program will output geometry to. leave blank to generate a new layer
BOUND_BOX_INPUT: a layer containing a polygon that the program will drop pins within
RASTER_INPUT: the input raster for the program. IMPORTANT: the input raster must have the same CRS as the bounding box

Parameters describing the basic geography of the field
ROW_VECTOR_INPUT: a direction vector, which the program takes in the form of a line, representing a row in the field.
The first point in the line is the start point for the field, so this is also implicitly a position vector. Don't
overthink this just find a place where the raster is a clear pattern and draw a line along a row. If the CRS is
different from BOUND_BOX_INPUT it will be automatically converted.
ROW_HEIGHT_INPUT: the distance between two rows, in the units of the CRS used by BOUND_BOX_INPUT
ROW_HEIGHT_STDEV_INPUT: the standard deviation of the row height values. The program will assume a gaussian distribution
and look within three standard deviations.
POINT_INTERVAL_INPUT: the interval between points on a row. (TODO: rename this?). Functions similar to row height.
POINT_INTERVAL_STDEV_INPUT: the standard deviation of the interval between points on a row. The program will assume a
gaussian distribution and look within three standard deviations.

Parameters for overlay comparisons
OVERLAY_BOX_RADIUS_INPUT: the radius of the box that the program will use for its comparisons, in field units
(i.e. the height and interval values specified in the above section). Defaults to 2, which means 2 units AROUND the spot
where the program is considering dropping a pin.
OVERLAY_MATCH_THRESHOLD: the threshold at which to declare an overlay box a match and drop a pin. I'm still figuring
this one out tbh

Cosmetic parameters:
FIELD_NAME_INPUT: the thing to name the field where the program puts the output data. Defaults to 'data'.

Algorithm Parameters
RATE_OFFSET_MATCH_FUNCTION_INPUT: the function to use to rate the match. "Regular" will produce a completely regular grid
COMPARE_FROM_ROOT_INPUT: whether to do rating comparisons from the root point (true) or from a neighboring point (false)
PRECISION_BIAS_COEFFICIENT_INPUT: number to weight matches to favor points near the predicted pin point. 0 for no weighting
